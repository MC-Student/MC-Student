- 👋 Hi, I’m @MC-Student - computer science major, finance minor!
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development/Engineering, AI, Cybersecurity, FinTech, Web Development, UI/UX, Data Science, and Big Data...so much potential out there! Especially anything cross-disciplinary.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures in Java, Operating Systems, Linux Systems Programming in C/C++, and lots more! I am also studying for the Microsoft Azure AI-900 certification test :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects hopefully in the near future...

- 👋 Hi, I’m @MC-Student - computer science major, finance minor!
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development/Engineering. The fields of AI, Cybersecurity, and FinTech are some of my favorites! Especially anything cross-disciplinary.
- 🌱 I’m currently a senior and am finishing up the major (graduating in June), so I'm applying to entry level/new grad opportunities in back-end software engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects hopefully in the near future...

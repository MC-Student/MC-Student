- 👋 Hi, I’m @MC-Student - computer science major, finance minor!
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development/Engineering, AI, Cybersecurity, FinTech, Web Development, UI/UX, Data Science, and Big Data...so much potential out there! Especially anything cross-disciplinary.
- 🌱 I’m currently a rising senior and will be taking my last 3 courses in the major: Programming Languages, Data Structures II, and Practicum in Software Development! Summer 2023 Back-End Developer intern @ Avanade :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects hopefully in the near future...
